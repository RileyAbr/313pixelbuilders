This repository is the base of operations for the overhaul of the Pixeled Brewing Co. website: <a href="pixeled.beer">pixeled.beer</a>. It is a full-scale website renovation, focusing on aesthetics and functionality for the business owners. Most importantly, the site holds an aura of funky 80's vibes and outrun-style.
